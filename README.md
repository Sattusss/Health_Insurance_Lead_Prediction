# Health Insurance Lead Prediction Prediction

This project focuses on predicting potential leads for health insurance based on various features and data points. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can identify individuals who are likely to be interested in purchasing health insurance policies. This README file provides an overview of the project, its components, and instructions for running and understanding the code.

## Project Overview
Health insurance lead prediction is crucial for insurance companies to optimize their marketing efforts and target potential customers effectively. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of an individual becoming a lead for health insurance.

The project involves several steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. Multiple machine learning algorithms are explored to identify the best-performing model for lead prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

- **ID**: Unique identifier for each individual.
- **City_Code**: Code representing the city where the individual resides.
- **Region_Code**: Code representing the region where the city is located.
- **Accomodation_Type**: Type of accommodation the individual has (own or rented).
- **Reco_Insurance_Type**: Type of recommended insurance policy.
- **Upper_Age**: Upper age limit of the individual.
- **Lower_Age**: Lower age limit of the individual.
- **Is_Spouse**: Indicates whether the individual has a spouse or not.
- **Health Indicator**: Health indicator code representing the individual's health condition.
- **Holding_Policy_Duration**: Duration for which the insurance policy has been held (in years).
- **Holding_Policy_Type**: Type of holding policy.
- **Reco_Policy_Cat**: Recommended policy category.
- **Reco_Policy_Premium**: Recommended policy premium amount.
- **Response**: Binary variable indicating whether the individual became a lead (1) or not (0) for health insurance.

The dataset is available in the `data/raw` directory with the file name `train.csv`.

## Project Structure

```

- **data/raw**: Contains the raw dataset `train.csv`.
- **data/processed**: This directory will be created to store the cleaned dataset.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, please follow the instructions below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Place the raw dataset file `train.csv` in the `data/raw` directory.

## Usage
To run the project and reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1. Open Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) in your web browser.
2. Create a new Colab notebook.
3. Upload the dataset file `train.csv` to the Colab notebook.
4. Run the code cells in the Colab notebook to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Results
After running the project in Google Colab, you will have a cleaned dataset ready for analysis and modeling. The code cells in the Colab notebook provide step-by-step guidance on data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training. You can analyze the dataset, gain insights, and evaluate different machine learning models for lead prediction.
